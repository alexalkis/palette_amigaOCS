# palette_amigaOCS.py

Copy the palette_amigaOCS.py to your .gimp-2.8/plug-ins/ folder, and chmod +x it.


On starting gimp you should have a new menu entry on Filters/Render/Palette Amiga OCS...

Try it (needs initial image to be in RGB mode).  You get to pick dither method and number of bitplanes.
